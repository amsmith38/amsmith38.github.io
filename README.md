This account was created to introduce me to Git Hub for my CTI110.
This repository was created to present my final portfolio project for CTI110 bringing together all of the concepts learned throughout the semester.
I created a repository in GitHub online. Then I cloned the repository to my desktop. Then I put my project files into the desktop repository. After adding a brief description, I committed my files. Then I pushed the files.
